# Mancala Game
## Overview

This project implements the classic Mancala board game using React for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend. The game includes a single-player mode where users can play against an AI opponent, which utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions. Additionally, the implementation leverages WebSockets for real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
